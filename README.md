## Contracts

### Lending and Borrowing

The `lending-and-borrowing` contract allows users to:
- Deposit STX tokens
- Withdraw STX tokens
- Borrow STX tokens against collateral
- Repay borrowed STX tokens
- Add collateral

### Yield Farming

The `yield-farming` contract enables users to:
- Stake STX tokens
- Unstake STX tokens
- Claim rewards based on the amount staked and time passed

### Stablecoin

The `stablecoin` contract implements a simple stablecoin with the following features:
- Minting (only by contract owner)
- Transferring between users
- Burning tokens

## Testing

Each contract has its own test file in the `tests` directory. You can run all tests using the `clarinet test` command.
